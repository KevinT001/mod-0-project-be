## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

While working on the project and being at the computer the Pomodoro technique helped a bit. It is still something I need to be more diligent about. I think I often forget or get into a zone and find myself staying at the computer.
The flow of the work did seem to be a little less stressful with being able to walk away and go pet my dog or drink/ eat a snack.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

The task I wanted to focus on was working on the mod 0 project. With it being a lengthier project, I thought it would be good to try and implement the pomodoro technique and give myself some short breaks. I did find myself focused and less strain on my eyes from being in front a computer so long. It helped give me a breather to walk away for about 5-10 minutes.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is different from an array because it the items in the list have assigned numerical values.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```
pet_store = {dog_food: 12, dog_toys: 32, dog_leashes: 14}
print pet_store
```


5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
print states [2]
```
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

```
states.keys

states.values
```
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Another example of a hash in real life could be a restaurant menu.
A menu could be broken down into breakfast key items, lunch items, dinner items, specials. With each of the listed items, the price/ value of each of those items attached to it

A hash is better than an array due to it being more specific and informative on the listed items.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

Are there any specific times where hashes are not ideal or can not be used when trying to list out items and values?
